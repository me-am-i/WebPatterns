# What is **WebPatterns**?
 - WebPatterns is a freely available repository of Boilerplate code to kickstart app development process. There are already established processes like [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) available for this purpose, but there are limitations. You cannot create one single `angular` pattern for all cases. Each app is different and has its own personality (IMHO). At the same, if you try to treat each app as a separate use case, you end up with a lot of repeating activity and `copy-pasting` the same boilerplate code again and again. As the great *Buddha* wisely said more than 2000 years ago, a *middle-path* is needed here - so boilerplate code is there, but you arrange them into *high-level patterns* and try to find the right pattern for the right job or app.

# How to run the patterns? 
 
 - Just download the pattern zip file from `/dist` folder, extract it and run it! The `README.md` in each pattern will contain any additional details along with dependencies.

# How do I develop or contribute a *Pattern*?

 - In case you wish to extend WebPatterns, just `git clone` this repo. To contribute a new pattern, just add it in a new folder and send me a `change request`. I'll add it.
 
# Where to file bug reports?

 - In the [Issues](https://github.com/prahladyeri/WebPatterns/issues) section of this github repo.
