This Template contains boilerplate code for creating an `angular.js bootstrap` app. Due credit to the [Angular-ui Team](http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/) for providing the essential `dialogService` to integrate `twitter-bootstrap dialogs` with `angularjs`.

*Bells and whistles* included:

- Basic session management on front-end side for login, logout and member registration.
- Angular `dataService` having session information and some dummy data.
- Angular `dialogService` to effortlessly show bootstrap modal dialogs.
